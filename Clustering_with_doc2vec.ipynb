        "The quality of the classes is determinant for training a classifier. In the famous MNIST example, the handwritten number '6' was always labeled correclty as a '6'. However, it is clear it would be very problematic if that digit was sometimes labels as '6', others as 'six', 'SIX', '6s', etc. In this case, it would be necessary to merge all these labels together before training. If not, the classifier would probably pick up irrelevant features of the '6' to try to distinguish between the classes '6', 'six', '6s', etc and end up with much less prediction accuracy.\n",

The same happens, for instance, with 'Attempts to collect debt not owed' and 'Cont'd attempts collect debt not owed'."
